v0.13 April 16 2018
-------------------

.. note::

    This release contains breaking changes, meaning an IncludeOS instance built with a previous version can not be updated to run an image built with this release's default IncludeOS version (Docker container v0.12.0-rc.4.1).

    Any running instances need to be rebuilt with this release's IncludeOS version and rebooted before new images can be deployed to them.

    Deploying an image to an instance with an incompatible IncludeOS version will result in an error.
