.. _Quick-start:

Quick start
===========

Dependencies
---------------
- `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`__
- `htpasswd <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html>`__

1 Create user
--------------
Mothership comes with basic auth authentication enabled by default. It is therefore necessary to create a user::

    $ touch .htpasswd               # Create empty .htpasswd file
    $ htpasswd -B .htpasswd myuser  # Add the user myuser

2 Configure TLS
----------------
TLS is also enabled by default. Mothership expects two files to be present in your directory:

:cert.pem: File containing your certificate.
:key.pem: File containing your private key

For instructions on how to generate a self signed certificate for testing see: :ref:`self-signed-tls`

3 Build and launch Mothership
------------------------------
First build then then run mothership using docker::

    $ docker build -t mothership .
    $ docker run \
        --name mothership \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -p 9090:9090 \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v $PWD:/home/ubuntu/mothership/ \
        mothership serve

The commands before ``mothership`` are **docker** options::

    --name mothership                   Give docker container name
    -p 8080:8080                        Forward port 8080
    -p 9090:9090                        Forward port 9090
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  Mount hosts docker process into container
    -v $PWD:/home/ubuntu/mothership/    Mount local dir into docker container

The commands after ``mothership`` are **mothership** options::

    mothership serve                    Start mothership server

This will launch the mothership server. Make sure there are no errors in the launch output and the two following lines indicates that basic auth and TLS are properly configured::

    time="xx" level=info msg="1 registered users"
    â‡¨ https server started on [::]:8080

4 Access Mothership
-------------------
There are three ways to interact with the Mothership server.

Web GUI
    This GUI is available at: `https://localhost:8080 <https://localhost:8080>`__, for more information on this please see: :ref:`Mothership GUI<the-website>`.
Command-line interface
    The binary ``mothership-linux-amd64`` used to launch the server also works as a CLI. 
API
    For more information on the various API endpoints see `Apidocs <https://127.0.0.1:8080/apidocs/apidocs.html>`__

Using the CLI the following command will give you information about the running instances::

    $ ./mothership-linux-amd64 --username myuser --password xx instances
    Instances:
    Instance ID  Service Name  Version  Arch  Online
