.. _Quick-start:

Quick start
===========

Dependencies
------------
- `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`__
- `htpasswd <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html>`__

1. Clone Git repository
-----------------------
::

    $ git clone git@github.com:includeos/mothership-beta.git

To clone using a specified unique ssh key::

    $ ssh-agent bash -c 'ssh-add mothership_beta.key; git clone git@github.com:includeos/mothership-beta.git'

2. Create user
--------------
Mothership comes with basic authentication enabled by default. It is therefore necessary to create a user:
::

    $ touch config_files/.htpasswd               # Create empty .htpasswd file
    $ htpasswd -B config_files/.htpasswd myuser  # Add the user myuser

3. Configure TLS
----------------
TLS is also enabled by default. Mothership expects two files to be present in the folder ``config_files``:

:cert.pem: File containing your certificate
:key.pem: File containing your private key

For instructions on how to generate a self-signed certificate for testing see: :ref:`self-signed-tls`

4. Build and launch Mothership
------------------------------
First build then then run mothership using docker::

    $ docker build -t mothership .
    $ docker run \
        --name mothership \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -p 9090:9090 \
        -v $PWD/config_files:/home/ubuntu/mothership/config_files \
        -v mothership_storage:/home/ubuntu/mothership/runtime_files \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        mothership serve

The options used are::

    First are the docker options:
        --name mothership                   Give docker container name
        -p 8080:8080                        Forward port 8080
        -p 9090:9090                        Forward port 9090
        -v $PWD/config_files:/home/ubuntu/mothership/config_files   Bind-mount config_files folder into mothership
        -v mothership_storage:/home/ubuntu/mothership/runtime_files Mount named volume into mothership
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  Mount hosts docker process into container
    Then the mothership options:
        mothership serve                    Start mothership server

.. note:: If you are experiencing problems with permissions for the mounted resources you might need to launch the docker container with ``--privileged``. On systems like RedHat Enterprise Linux that use SELinux this might be necessary. 

This will launch the mothership server. Make sure there are no errors in the launch output and the two following lines indicates that basic auth and TLS are properly configured::

    time="xx" level=info msg="1 registered users"
    â‡¨ https server started on [::]:8080

5. Access Mothership
--------------------
There are three ways to interact with the Mothership server.

Web GUI
    This GUI is available at: `https://localhost:8080 <https://localhost:8080>`__, for more information on this please see: :ref:`Mothership GUI<the-website>`
API
    For more information on the various API endpoints, see the API documentation at `https://localhost:8080/apidocs/apidocs.html <https://localhost:8080/apidocs/apidocs.html>`__
Command-line interface
    The binary ``mothership-linux-amd64`` used to launch the server also works as a CLI

Using the CLI the following command will give you information about the running instances::

    $ ./mothership-linux-amd64 --username myuser --password <password> instances
    Instances:
    Instance ID  Service Name  Version  Arch  Online
